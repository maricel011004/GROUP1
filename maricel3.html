       <h2>by Taylor Swift</h2>
       <h3>There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
        Same old tired, lonely place<br>
        Walls of insincerity<br>
        Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face<br>
        All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you<br><br>

        Your eyes whispered "have we met?"<br>
        Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me<br>
        The playful conversation starts<br>
        Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy<br>
        And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
        All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

        This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home<br>
        I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        The lingering question kept me up<br>
        Two a.m., who do you love?<br>
        I wonder till I'm wide awake<br>
        Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door<br>
        I'd open up and you would say, hey<br>
        It was enchanting to meet you<br>
        All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you<br><br>

        This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home<br>
        I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
        This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone<br>
        I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br><br>

        This is me praying that this was the very first page<br>
        Not where the story line ends<br>
        My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again<br>
        These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon<br>
        I was enchanted to meet you<br>
        Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
        Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
        Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
        Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br><br>
        
        This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
        I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home<br>
        I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
        This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
