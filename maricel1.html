       <h3>I will always remember<br>
        The day you kissed my lips<br>
        Light as a feather<br>
        And it went just like this<br>
        No, it's never been better<br>
        Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)<br><br>

        Mm, we were only 11<br>
        But acting like grown-ups<br>
        Like we are in the present<br>
        Drinking from plastic cups<br>
        Singing, "Love is forever and ever"<br>
        Well, I guess that was true (ooh)<br><br>

        Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
        On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>
        Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
        And it went like this, say<br><br>

        Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
        Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
        Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>
        Paint a picture for you and me<br>
        Of the days when we were young, uh<br>
        Singing at the top of both our lungs<br><br>

        Now we're under the covers<br>
        Fast forward to 18<br>
        We are more than lovers<br>
        Yeah, we are all we need<br>
        When we're holding each other<br>
        I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)<br>
        Yeah<br><br>

        On the day we fell in love<br>
        Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br>

        Ooh-oh ooh-oh<br><br>
