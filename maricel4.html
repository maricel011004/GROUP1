       <center><h1>SAY YOU WON'T LET GO</h1>
       <h2>by James Arthur</h2>
       <h3>I met you in the dark<br>
        You lit me up<br>
        You made me feel as though<br>
        I was enough<br>
        We danced the night away<br>
        We drank too much<br>
        I held your hair back when<br>
        You were throwing up<br><br>

        Then you smiled over your shoulder<br>
        For a minute, I was stone cold sober<br>
        I pulled you closer to my chest<br>
        And you asked me to stay over<br>
        I said, "I already told ya<br>
        I think that you should get some rest"<br><br>

        I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know<br>
        'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go<br>
        I knew I needed you, but I never showed<br>
        But I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old<br>
        Just say you won't let go<br>
        Just say you won't let go<br><br>

        I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed<br>
        I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head<br>
        And I'll take the kids to school<br>
        Wave them goodbye<br>
        And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night<br><br>

        When you looked over your shoulder<br>
        For a minute, I forget that I'm older<br>
        I wanna dance with you right now, oh<br>
        And you look as beautiful as ever<br>
        And I swear that everyday you'll get better<br>
        You make me feel this way somehow<br><br>

        I'm so in love with you<br>
        And I hope you know<br>
        Darling, your love is more than what its weight in gold<br>
        We've come so far my dear<br>
        Look how we've grown<br>
        And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old<br>
        Just say you won't let go<br>
        Just say you won't let go<br>
        I wanna live with you<br>
        Even when we're ghosts<br>
        'Cause you were always there for me<br>
        When I needed you most<br><br>

        I'm gonna love you 'til my lungs give out<br>
        I promise 'til death we part like in our vows<br>
        So I wrote this song for you<br>
        Now everybody knows<br>
        That it's just you and me 'til we're grey and old<br>
        Just say you won't let go<br>
        Just say you won't let go<br><br>

        Just say you won't let go<br>
        Oh, just say you won't let go<br></h3></center><hr width="50%">
