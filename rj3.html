       <h2>by The Weeknd</h2>
       <h3>Record man play my song on the radio<br>
        You too busy trying to find that blue-eyed soul<br>
        I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke<br>
        And I swear too much on the regular<br>
        We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go<br>
        If it ain't XO then it gotta go<br>
        I just won a new award for a kids show<br>
        Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow<br><br>

        I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice<br>
        Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy<br>
        Whip game, make a nigga understand though<br>
        Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo<br>
        Hit the gas so hard make it rotate<br>
        All my niggas blew up like a propane<br>
        All these R&B niggas be so lame<br>
        Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)<br><br>

        You know me, know me<br>
        You know, man, know, man, know, man<br>
        You know me, know me, know me<br>
        Every time you try to forget who I am<br>
        I'll be right there to remind you again<br>
        You know me, know me (pow, pow)<br>
        You know me, know me<br><br>

        Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean<br>
        Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion<br>
        All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit<br>
        It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit<br><br>

        Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me<br>
        Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine<br>
        Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed<br>
        I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG<br><br>

        All my niggas get it, they make money all alone<br>
        Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home<br>
        When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show<br>
        And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know<br><br>

        Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor<br>
        Now my shit straight, eating all day, tryna lose weight<br>
        That good sex, we'll sweat it out<br>
        Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out<br>
        I ain't gotta tell you 'cause you know me<br><br>

        You know me, know me<br>
        You know, man, know, man, know, man<br>
        You know me, know me, know me<br>
        Every time you try to forget who I am<br>
        I'll be right there to remind you again<br>
        You know me, know me (pow, pow)<br>
        You know me, know me (know me, know me)<br><br>

        Why don't you shake some, shake somethin' for the Don?<br>
        Don't you break nothin', break nothin', baby girl<br>
        Won't you work some, work somethin' for the Don?<br>
        Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin', big girl<br>
        Won't you shake some, shake somethin' for the Don?<br>
        Don't you break nothin', break nothin', baby girl<br>
        Won't you work some, work somethin' for the Don?<br>
        Don't you hurt nothin', hurt nothin'<br><br>

        'Cause you know me, they know me<br>
        You're a no-man, yeah, you know, man<br>
        Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na<br>
        Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na<br>
        Oh-oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na<br>
