       <h3>I'm findin' ways to articulate the feeling I'm goin' through<br>
        I just can't say I don't love you<br>
        'Cause I love you, yeah<br>
        It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold<br>
        But tonight, I'm gon' let you know<br>
        Let me tell the truth<br>
        Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah<br><br>

        You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes<br>
        You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
        You're scared to be lonely, especially in the night<br>
        I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time<br>
        I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love<br>
        I try to find a reason to pull us apart<br>
        It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
        And I know that you're worth it<br>
        I can't walk away, (oh)<br><br>

        Even though we're going through it<br>
        And it makes you feel alone<br>
        Just know that I would die for you<br>
        Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
        The distance and the time between us<br>
        It'll never change my mind<br>
        'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
        Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br><br>

        I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're going through<br>
        But baby-girl, I'm not blaming you<br>
        Just don't blame me too, yeah<br>
        'Cause I can't take this pain forever<br>
        And you won't find no one that's better<br>
        'Cause I'm right for you, babe<br>
        I think I'm right for you, babe<br><br>

        You know what I'm thinking, see it in your eyes<br>
        You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry<br>
        It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect<br>
        And I know that you're worth it<br>
        I can't walk away<br><br>

        Even though we're going through it<br>
        And it makes you feel alone<br>
        Just know that I would die for you<br>
        Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
        The distance and the time between us<br>
        It'll never change my mind<br>
        'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
        Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>

        I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
        Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
        I'm just sayin', yeah<br>
        I would die for you, I would lie for you<br>
        Keep it real with you, I would kill for you, my baby<br>
        Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na<br><br>

        Even though we're going through it<br>
        And it makes you feel alone<br>
        Just know that I would die for you<br>
        Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br>
        The distance and the time between us<br>
        It'll never change my mind<br>
        'Cause baby, I would die for you<br>
        Baby, I would die for you, yeah<br><br>
